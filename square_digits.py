# Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.
# For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.
# Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.

Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer
